## Chapter 1: Introduction

**Core Design Goal: Reliability**
  **Accurate Calculations:** Performed by reliable Python tools, not the LLM.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Establish an automated evaluation framework.
*   Build a functional Proof-of-Concept.
*   Design for flexibility amidst rapid AI advancements.

**Scope:**
*   **Query/API (Partially Implemented / Future Work):** Context retrieval (re-ranking - Future), automated evaluation (Future), system logging (Future)

---

## Chapter 2: Data Ingestion Pipeline

**Financial Document "AST" Analogy:**
Similar to how Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) capture code structure, these initial stages create a structural representation of the financial document. This allows the system to understand hierarchy and components beyond raw text, crucial for accurate filtering and contextual understanding by the LLM.

---

## Chapter 3: Retrieval Process

**Handling Complex Queries (Future):** An LLM may decompose complex questions into sub-queries, making multiple calls to retrieval or other tools.

**Refining Results (Re-ranking - Future):** Initial results may be re-ranked using more advanced models for better relevance.

---

## Chapter 4: Answer Generation & Tools

**Guiding the AI (Prompting - Implemented):**
Prompts are critical for reliability. Key principles embedded in system prompts include:
*   **Clarity:** Direct instructions ("MUST", "MUST NOT").
*   **Groundedness:** *Only* use provided document text.
*   **Graceful Refusal:** Instruct how to respond if information is missing.

---

## Chapter 5: Final Output & Sources

The AI's raw answer undergoes final processing.

**Basic Checks (Future):** Validating numbers against source text and checking for correct refusal messages.

---

## Chapter 6: Evaluation

**Why Evaluate?**
To prove reliability, not just assume it. Evaluation measures performance, identifies issues, validates improvements, and demonstrates system trustworthiness.

**The Need for Rigorous, Quantitative Evals:**
Reliability in finance is non-negotiable. A rigorous, quantitative evaluation framework is essential for building trust and guiding development, ensuring accuracy.

**Test Data:**
Primarily uses synthetic financial PDFs created in-house, allowing control over content and known correct answers for various report types and periods.

**Creating Test Cases:**
A "Golden Dataset" of (Question, Correct Answer, Ground Truth Source Sections, Expected Numbers, Is_Refusal_Correct?) is created. This includes cases where refusal is the correct response.

**Measuring Performance:**
Automated measurement against the Golden Dataset covers:
*   **Number Accuracy:** Correctness of numerical values.
*   **Faithfulness:** Answer uses *only* provided document sections (LLM-assisted check).
*   **Source Accuracy:** Citations point to correct sources.
*   **Retrieval Performance:** Effectiveness in finding relevant sections.
*   **Refusal Accuracy:** Correctly refusing unanswerable questions.
*   **Structured Extraction Accuracy:** For table/metric extraction against ground truth.

**RAG Evaluation: Key Tips & Metrics:**
*(This section remains detailed as it provides foundational guidance for RAG system evaluation.)*

**Core Principle:** Evaluate the **Retriever** (finds info) and the **Generator** (creates answer) separately and together.

#### I. High-Value Evaluation Tips:
1.  **Smart Test Data is King:**
    *   "Golden" Datasets: Manually verified (Question, Ideal Answer, Ideal Source(s)).
    *   Synthetic Data Nuance: Use LLMs for diverse Q&A pairs *from your documents*, including unanswerable ones. Quality check samples.
2.  **LLM-as-a-Judge (Carefully!):** Use another LLM for subjective assessments (faithfulness, relevance) with specific prompts. Calibrate against human judgments.
3.  **Focus on Failure Modes:** Test known weaknesses (complex tables, date reasoning).
4.  **The Iterative Loop:** Evaluate -> Analyze Failures -> Hypothesize Fix -> Implement -> Re-Evaluate.

#### II. Key Metrics (Most Useful & Actionable):

**A. Evaluating the Retriever:**
*   **1. Context Precision (LLM-as-Judge):** % of retrieved chunks truly relevant to the question. *Why: Are we feeding good info to the generator?*
*   **2. Context Recall (LLM-as-Judge - advanced):** Of all relevant info, how much was found? *Why: Is critical info being missed?*
*   **3. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Top-K Retrieval:** How high up is the *first* correct chunk? *Why: Good for top-result user scenarios.*

**B. Evaluating the Generator:**
*   **1. Faithfulness / Groundedness (LLM-as-Judge):** Does the answer *only* use retrieved context? Avoids hallucination? *Why: Critical for reliability.*
*   **2. Answer Relevance (LLM-as-Judge):** Does the answer directly address the user's question? *Why: Is the LLM answering the specific question?*

**Remember:** Use a combination of metrics, connected to user experience and business goals.

**Automation:**
An automated script runs test cases and calculates metrics, enabling rapid feedback on changes.

**Improving with Evaluation:**
1.  Test to find weaknesses.
2.  Make targeted improvements (prompts, retrieval, parsing, tools).
3.  Re-test to confirm improvements and check for regressions.
4.  Track results to demonstrate reliability gains.

## Chapter 7: Monitoring & Logs (Future Work)

Comprehensive system monitoring and detailed logging (e.g., to Supabase) will be implemented to track performance, diagnose issues, and understand usage patterns in a production environment. This includes logging key events, errors, AI interactions, and resource utilization.

## Chapter 8: Next Steps

### 8.1 Immediate Next Steps

### 8.2 Future Enhancements

*   **Integrations with External Data Sources:** QuickBooks, Gmail (for financial document processing), cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox) with strict access controls.

*   Advanced context retrieval (graph-based methods, query transformation).
*   Fine-tuning models.
*   OCR for scanned PDFs.

## Chapter 9: Strategic Considerations and Future Vision

### 9.1 The "Bitter Lesson": Vertical vs. Horizontal AI Applications

The "Bitter Lesson" suggests general AI methods eventually outperform specialized ones. This means "vertical workflows" like this assistant (specialized, engineered for current models) could be vulnerable to powerful, general "horizontal agents" from large labs as AI improves. Reliance solely on the AI processing pipeline is a long-term risk.

### 9.2 Implications of Opaque AI Reasoning

As AI reasoning becomes less interpretable ("latent space"), auditing AI decisions becomes harder. This reinforces the design choices of:
*   **Deterministic Calculation Tools:** Ensuring numerical results are transparent and auditable.
*   **Grounded Answers with Citations:** Providing verifiable links to human-readable source documents, crucial for trust.

### 9.3 Impact of Future Models

Highly capable future models ("GPT-5 level") might reduce the need for current data preparation steps like chunking, embedding, and complex RAG. The system's value would shift from data prep to orchestrating these powerful models securely, reliably, and verifiably. Core components like Supabase, API, calculation tools, and citation logic would remain vital.

### 9.4 Defending Against General Agents

To defend against general AI agents, the Project must focus on:
1.  **Trust and Security Moat:** A secure, multi-tenant platform for sensitive financial data with guaranteed isolation and auditability.
2.  **Reliability and Accuracy for Domain-Specific Tasks:** Validated accuracy for specific financial analyses using deterministic tools and rigorous evaluation.
3.  **Domain-Specific User Experience & Workflow Integration:** Tailored financial workflows and interfaces.
4.  **Regulatory and Compliance Readiness:** Features for financial compliance and auditability.

This strategy leverages strengths (security, reliability, domain expertise) to complement general AI capabilities, becoming a valuable, trusted component in the future AI ecosystem.
