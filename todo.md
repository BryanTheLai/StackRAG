Notes:
Current AI CFO is **reliable (Trust is Non-Negotiabl)** Q&A for SMEs on Financial PDFs.
SAAS is about **Abstraction and Automation** complexity.
?What does it save in time or cost? 
For example:
- Old Way: 2 hours per day searching
- New way: 30 minutes per day searching
- Time saved: 1.5 hours per person
- Accountant Salary: RM 5000/month

Accountants work 21 days per month and 8 hours per day.
Hourly rate is (RM5000/(21*8)) = RM 29.76
Daily cost saving per person from redces search time = 1.5 h * Rm 29.76 = RM44.64
Conclusion: Accountants save (RM44.64/day * 21) RM937.44 per month.

Price at 30% value capture so RM270.

# Retrieval
1. Negated prompts, make sure llm knows to reverse it before query, or use sql query filtering, which is even better.
2. Complex prompts that require multihop queries. For this, try decompose or plan, the query.
3. Fuzzy filtering queries. Plan more for better filtering.

Eval is important.
User feedback like thumbs up doesnt tell why system failed (UX, Hallucination, Bad Retrieval, Missing Data)
