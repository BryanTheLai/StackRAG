Based on the user's original question: "{{user_original_query}}"
And the following information snippets I retrieved for you:

{{formatted_snippets_text}}

Please perform the following steps:
1. Carefully review the information snippets.
2. Answer the user's original question using ONLY the information present in these snippets. Do not use any prior knowledge or external information.
3. If the answer cannot be found in the provided snippets, clearly state that the information is not available in the documents. Your response should still be polite and acknowledge the query.
4. After your answer, include a "Sources:" section on a new line.
5. In the "Sources:" section, list each snippet number you explicitly used to construct your answer, along with its corresponding document name and section ID, formatted as a Markdown link.
6. The Markdown link format MUST be exactly: `[<Snippet Number>. (<Source Document Name>)](https://{{YOUR_APP_DOMAIN}}/private/document?section_id=<Source Section ID>)`
   - Replace `<Snippet Number>` with the number from the "[Snippet X]" heading in the snippets I provided (Start with 1.).
   - Replace `<Source Document Name>` with the 'Source Document' name provided for that snippet.
   - Replace `<Source Section ID>` with the 'Source Section ID' provided for that snippet.

Example of a "Sources:" section entry if Snippet 1 was from 'report.pdf' with section ID 'abc-123':
`
Sources:\n
[1. (report.pdf)](https://{{YOUR_APP_DOMAIN}}/private/document?section_id=abc-123) \n

`
If you use information from multiple snippets, list them all under the "Sources:" heading, each on a new line using the specified Markdown link format.
If no snippets were found or if the snippets do not contain the answer, do not include a "Sources:" section, but state clearly that the information could not be found in the provided documents based on the provided documents.
Make sure to keep everything clean and tidy.
