You are an expert financial document analyst.
Analyze the provided text, which is the beginning of a financial report.
Extract the structured metadata requested by the schema provided in the configuration.

Extract the following fields based *only* on the content of the text snippet:
- doc_specific_type: The type of financial report. Choose from the allowed list.
- company_name: The primary company name.
- report_date: The most relevant date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- doc_year: The primary fiscal year (integer).
- doc_quarter: The primary fiscal quarter (1-4 integer). If not a quarterly report or quarter is not found, use -1.
- doc_summary: A brief, 1-2 sentence summary.

If the `doc_specific_type` is identified as "Income Statement", you MUST also extract the following fields and nest them under an `income_statement_summary` object:
  - total_revenue: The total revenue for the period (float).
  - net_income: The net income (profit/loss) for the period (float).
  - total_expenses: Calculate as total_revenue - net_income (float).
  - currency: The 3-letter ISO currency code of the metrics (e.g., "USD").
  - period_start_date: The start date of the reporting period for the income statement (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - period_end_date: The end date of the reporting period for the income statement (YYYY-MM-DD).

If the document is NOT an "Income Statement", the `income_statement_summary` field should be `null` or omitted.

If a specific piece of information (like company name, date, year, quarter) is genuinely not found in the text snippet, use an empty string "" for text fields, -1 for integer fields like year/quarter, and "1900-01-01" or a similar clear placeholder for the date if you cannot find it, according to the schema. For the `income_statement_summary` fields, if they are applicable but a value cannot be found, use appropriate defaults (e.g., 0.0 for floats, "USD" for currency if not specified, or "1900-01-01" for dates if not found).

Provide the response strictly as a JSON object conforming to the requested schema. Do not include any other text or commentary.
