# AI CFO Assistant: Strategic Roadmap & PMF Playbook (Concise)

**Version:** 1.4
**Date:** May 7, 2025

## 1. Core Mission & Value Proposition

*   **Mission:** Turn SME financial PDFs into actionable intelligence.
*   **Value Prop:** Automate extraction & structuring of data from financial statements (B/S, I/S, C/F), eliminating manual "schlepy" work.

## 2. Target User & Initial Focus

*   **Target User (Persona):** SME Finance Professionals (CFOs, Controllers, Sr. Accountants, FP&A) with acute pain in manual PDF data extraction.
*   **Initial Document Focus:** Income Statements (I/S), Balance Sheets (B/S), Cash Flow Statements (C/F).
*   **Problem Focus:** The time-consuming, error-prone manual extraction of data from these PDFs for analysis and reporting.

## 3. Product-Market Fit (PMF) Strategy - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Goal:** Achieve strong PMF by relentlessly solving the core problem for our target persona. PMF is often found through iteration and pivoting.

### 3.1. Core PMF Playbook (The "PMF Engine"):

1.  **Survey Early Users:** After initial use, ask the key question:
    > *"How would you feel if you could no longer use [AI CFO Assistant]?"*
    *   **A) Very disappointed**
    *   B) Somewhat disappointed
    *   C) Not disappointed
2.  **Target: 40%+ "Very Disappointed" Responses** from your target persona. This is the primary PMF leading indicator.
3.  **Segment & Analyze Feedback:**
    *   **"Very Disappointed" Users (Champions):**
        *   *Why they love it?* (Identifies your core value / "Promise").
        *   *Who else benefits most?* (Refines your "Persona").
    *   **Relevant "Somewhat Disappointed" Users:** (Those whose core need aligns with Champions).
        *   *How to improve for them?* (High-value "Product" roadmap input).
    *   Politely disregard other feedback to maintain focus.
4.  **Build/Iterate Roadmap:**
    *   ~50% effort: Double down on what Champions love.
    *   ~50% effort: Address key improvements for the relevant "Somewhat Disappointed" group.
5.  **Secure "10 True Fans":** Achieve a core group of highly satisfied ("Very Disappointed") and engaged users.
6.  **Founder-Led Sales/Onboarding:** Manually onboard early users. Provides invaluable learning, builds relationships, and ensures quality feedback (Reducto insight). *Talk to people constantly.*

### 3.2. Strategic Pivoting Levers (The "Four P's" Framework - First Round Capital):

If stuck or traction is low, consider adjusting:
*   **Problem:** Are you solving a high-pain, must-have problem? (Vanta, Lattice examples).
*   **Persona:** Is this the right ICP with consistent usage and willingness to pay? (Clay, Plaid examples).
*   **Promise:** How are you articulating your unique value? Is it resonating? (Ironclad example).
*   **Product:** Is your solution effectively delivering on the promise for the problem? (Alma, Rupa Health examples).
    *Key Quote (Lattice): "More often than not, if you're working on something that is not getting great traction, you’re probably not a 10% adjustment away — you’re probably a 200% adjustment away."*

### 3.3. Key PMF Validation Metrics (Beyond Survey):

*   **Extraction Accuracy:** >95% for key line items (trust is paramount).
*   **Time Saved per Cycle:** >50% reduction (user-reported impact).
*   **Active Engagement from Target Users:** Consistent usage by your "True Fans."

## 4. Core Capabilities & Evolution

### 4.1. Must-Have Now (MVP for PMF):

*   **Reliable PDF Ingestion:** B/S, I/S, C/F.
*   **Accurate Structured Data Extraction:** Key financial line items and tables into a structured format (DB, CSV).
*   **Basic Output:** Clean CSV/Excel download.

### 4.2. High-ROI Future Evolution (Driven by PMF Feedback):

1.  **API Access:** For spreadsheet & accounting software integration.
2.  **Deterministic Financial Calculations:** Ratios, variance, flux using extracted data.
3.  **Natural Language Query:** On extracted structured data.
4.  **Improved PDF Format Handling:** Continuously expand based on user needs.

## 5. Moats & Defensibility (Top 3)

1.  **Superior Extraction Accuracy & Robustness:** For your target niche's financial PDFs.
2.  **Deep Workflow Integration (API):** Becoming indispensable to users' existing tools.
3.  **Trusted Brand:** Built on accuracy, reliability, and solving real pain.

## 6. Key Strategic Insights

*   **Solve the "Schlep" First:** Accurate data extraction is the foundational, high-value problem.
*   **Talk to Customers Constantly:** Before building, when stuck, always.
*   **Prototype Rapidly:** Especially for new features or AI components ("Prototypes are the new PRD" - Figma).

## 7. Technology & Implementation Notes (Brief)

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), robust PDF parsing.
*   **Database:** Store extracted structured line items and document metadata.
*   **Core Logic:** Prioritize deterministic extraction and calculation. For AI features, use human-centric evaluation (Figma insight).

## 8. Key Risks & Mitigation (Top 2)

1.  **Extraction Accuracy:** Mitigation: Rigorous testing, iterative model improvement on target persona's documents, clear communication of capabilities.
2.  **Achieving True PMF (Not just "nice-to-have"):** Mitigation: Relentless focus on the PMF Engine, willingness to pivot using the Four P's, deep customer interaction.

## 9. Next Steps (Immediate PMF Focus) - HIGHEST PRIORITY ACTIONS

1.  **Build/Refine MVP Parser:** Achieve high accuracy for line-item & table extraction from I/S, B/S, C/F for initial target persona formats.
2.  **Recruit & Onboard Pilot Users (5-10):** Target your defined persona. *Manually onboard every user* to learn, build relationships, and fix issues rapidly.
3.  **Execute PMF Engine:** Systematically survey users, analyze feedback, and iterate quickly towards the **40%+ "Very Disappointed"** target. Focus on what Champions love and what relevant "Somewhat Disappointed" users need.
4.  **Iterate on Product/Promise/Persona/Problem:** Be prepared to make significant adjustments based on feedback and PMF signals.
