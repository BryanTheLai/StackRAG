# Note 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC 820, *Fair Value Measurements*, states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The
three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I)
observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are
observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value
hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were
measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

| | December 31, 2021 | | | | December 31, 2020 | | |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :--- | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :--- |
|  | Fair Value | Level I | Level II | Level III | Fair Value | Level I | Level II | Level III |
| Money market funds (cash and cash equivalents) | $ 9,548 | $ 9,548 | $ – | $ – | $ 13,847 | $ 13,847 | $ – | $ – |
| Corporate debt securities (short-term marketable securities) | 131 | – | 131 | – | – | – | – | – |
| Interest rate swap liabilities | 31 | – | 31 | – | 58 | – | 58 | – |
| Total | $ 9,710 | $ 9,548 | $ 162 | $ – | $ 13,905 | $ 13,847 | $ 58 | $ – |

All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted
prices in active markets. Our marketable securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach
was used to determine fair value of these investments. Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy
because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs, including current and
forward interest rates.
